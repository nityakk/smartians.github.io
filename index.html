          Smartsheet is a collaborative work management software based out of
          Bellevue, WA. We worked with the Smartsheet Compliance Team led by
          Sam Bradley. The compliance team focuses on all compliance and security
          related items at Smartsheet.

        <p>
          Our project aims to solve a myriad of problems with the current quarterly
          access review process at Smartsheet. Smartsheet’s access reviews are
          time-consuming and draws a lot of resources.

          Our Identity and Access Management Dashboard presents:
          <ul class="about">
            <li>Employee change metrics tracked with custom automations</li>
            <li>Report containing daily employee changes with changed data attribute highlighted</li>
            <li>Metrics are used to present historical data of employee changes</li>
          </ul>

          <strong class="coloredtext">With our Dashboard, Smartsheet’s Compliance
            team will be able to save time and resources with the addition of
            having key actionable insights to employee changes.
          </strong>

            <strong>Note:</strong>
            Quarterly access reviews are when a company’s compliance team ensures
            that employees have the correct access permissions to applications.
