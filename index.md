# Smartsheet Identity and Access Management (IAM) Automation
## Automating the quarterly access review process

### Project Description
This project has the goal to simplify the quarterly access review process by encapsulating relevant  employee changes into a Smartsheet dashboard. This dashboard is to be used by the Compliance team. The dashboard presents key employee change metrics and a report that contains daily employee changes, highlighting the data attribute that was changed and highlights employees that have left the company. With this tool, the compliance team can easily see quarterly changes to employee data, making the quarterly access review easier and faster. Additional features can continue to be added to the tool in the future.
